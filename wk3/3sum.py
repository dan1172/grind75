# naive solution: sort, then 


# Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
# Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]


# Input: nums = [0,1,1]
# Output: []
# Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.


# Input: nums = [0,0,0]
# Output: [[0,0,0]]
# Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

# 3 <= nums.length <= 3000
# -105 <= nums[i] <= 105
